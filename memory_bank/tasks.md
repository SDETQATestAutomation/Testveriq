# Test Automation Framework - Task Tracking

## VAN Stage Tasks
### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Initialize Memory Bank structure
- [x] Create project brief with core objectives
- [x] Define active context with key questions
- [x] Establish design principles and success criteria

### ‚è≥ In Progress
- [ ] Gather stakeholder requirements (waiting for input)
- [x] Finalize technology stack based on requirements
- [x] Assess framework complexity level (1-4 scale)

### üìã Pending VAN Stage
- [x] Document value proposition and ROI analysis
- [x] Create risk assessment matrix
- [x] Define acceptance criteria for framework
- [x] Prepare transition criteria for PLAN stage

## Future Stage Tasks (Planned)

### PLAN Stage (Next)
- [x] Create detailed architecture blueprint
- [x] Define framework modules and components
- [x] Design class hierarchy and interfaces
- [x] Create implementation timeline
- [x] Define testing strategy for framework itself

### CREATIVE Stage
- [x] Design innovative solutions for complex components
- [x] Create custom utilities and helpers
- [x] Design reporting templates and dashboards
- [x] Explore advanced patterns (Page Object Model+)

### IMPLEMENT Stage
- [ ] Set up project structure and Maven configuration
- [ ] Implement core framework components
- [ ] Create base classes and utilities
- [ ] Implement driver management
- [ ] Build reporting and logging modules
- [ ] Create example test scenarios

### QA Stage
- [ ] Framework unit testing
- [ ] Integration testing with sample applications
- [ ] Performance and load testing
- [ ] Documentation review and validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Decision Points
### Technology Stack (Pending Input)
- **Testing Framework**: TestNG vs JUnit 5
- **BDD Tool**: Cucumber vs direct test methods
- **Reporting**: Allure vs ExtentReports vs custom
- **Grid/Cloud**: Local vs Selenium Grid vs cloud services

### Framework Complexity Assessment
- **Level 1**: Simple web automation (basic Page Object Model)
- **Level 2**: Multi-platform with parallel execution
- **Level 3**: Enterprise features (custom reporting, data-driven, API integration)
- **Level 4**: Advanced patterns (microservices testing, AI-powered features)

## Risk Items
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment on requirements
- [ ] Technology compatibility with target applications
- [ ] Team skill level with chosen technologies
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration complexity
- [ ] Maintenance and support model

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Framework adoption rate
- [ ] Test execution time reduction
- [ ] Defect detection efficiency
- [ ] Maintenance effort reduction
- [ ] Team productivity improvement
